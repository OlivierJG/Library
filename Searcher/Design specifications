Use cases:
    a. Looking for a specific document, title known
      Marginal importance. Browse-mode filter should cover this.
    b. Looking for a specific document, title unknown/Looking for the originating document(s) of a quote
      High-priority. While a good quote should put the document at/near the top of any search, in some cases filtering results by folder/type, or even size may prove very useful.
      Any filtering would usually be simple, limited to eg, one folder, one type
    c. Looking for any documents that discuss given topic ("googley search")
      High Priority. More advanced filtering may be useful.

Notes:
    Based on use cases, advanced queries, with the exception of the quoted term, will be rarely used (not a, possibly b & c, but only by advanced power users)

Interfaces:
    TreeView, no sorting, no filtering, scroll to get more
	a: Covered adequately
	b: Somewhat wanting. Lack of filters could result in deluge of unwanted document types/categories in some cases
	c: Functional, but lack of filtering, sorting would hurt at times
    TreeView with simple filter, no sorting, scroll to get more
	a: Covered adequately
